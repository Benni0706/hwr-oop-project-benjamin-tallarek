# HWR OOP Lecture Project arduino motion sensor

This repository contains a student project created for an ongoing lecture on object-oriented programming with Java at HWR Berlin (summer term 2022).

> :warning: This code is for educational purpose only. Do not rely on it!

## Abstract

This programme controls a motion detector that is controlled via an Arduino. Communication is message-based via the serial interface.
The biggest difficulty was to make the code that controls the serial interface testable.

## Feature List

[TODO]: # (For each feature implemented, add a row to the table!)

| Number | Feature | Tests |
|--------|---------|-------|
| 1      | activating the sensor| /     |
| 2      | deactivating the sensor| /     |
| 3      | listening for motion detections| /     |
| 4      | /       | /     |
| 5      | /       | /     |


## Additional Dependencies

[TODO]: # (For each additional dependency your project requires- Add an additional row to the table!)

| Number | Dependency Name | Dependency Description | Why is it necessary? |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| 1      | /               | /                      | /                    |
